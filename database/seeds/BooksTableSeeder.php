                            Its full title was On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.
                            It was published in London by John Murray in November 1859. It was translated into many languages, and has been in print ever since. The title since the 6th edition of 1872 has been The Origin of Species. This is the most important single book in the biological sciences, and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research.',

His goal in the first chapter of the book is to survey whats already been said about dreaming so that readers are well-prepared for his own thoughts on the subject.
                        After laying his critical groundwork, Freud jumps right into a specimen dreamâ€”his Dream of Irmas Injection. Freuds detailed interpretation of the dream is a hands-on demonstration of his unique methodology, and he concludes his analysis by arguing that his Dream of Irmas Injection fulfilled an unconscious wish. In fact, Freud doesn t stop there: he goes on to argue that every dream is "the fulfilment of a wish"',

                            Annes family has emigrated to Holland from Germany for two reasons, the first is Mr. Frank has taken a job there and the second is to move away from the Nazi Party. The Nazis are making life very restrictive for the Jewish people in Germany.
                            Even though they have left Germany, the Jewish restrictions of the Nazi Party still exist in Holland. They all are required to wear a yellow star on their clothing, attend only Jewish schools, shop at Jewish stores and other restrictions also apply. The full impact of the restrictions and horrors of the Nazi Party are felt by the family on the day Annes sister, Margot, is called up. This means that she is to be taken away, in all probability to a concentration camp. The family knew they would one day have to go into hiding and had been making preparations for the move, this just moved up the time table of when they would go.',
